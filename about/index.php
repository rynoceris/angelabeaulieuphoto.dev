					<h2>about</h2>
					
					<p>Photography has always been apart of my every day life. I spent many years selling cameras at a local electronics store and that same store is where I bought my first DSLR.</p>

					<p>To me, there is nothing more wonderful than capturing life's most precious moments in time. What started me on wedding photography was taking a look at my own wedding photos and being reminded just how horrible they were and how upset I was about them. Ever since my own wedding day, Ive thrived to make sure no other bride goes through the emotions I had to. So that is what started me on weddings.</p>

					<p>I would be honored to photograph any special event or time in your life, if you would let me. I am located in beautiful New Port Richey, Florida and I'm always willing to travel. Please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me with any questions or if you would like to book a session.</p>
