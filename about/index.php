			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I discovered at a young age that I loved photography. After all, considering I was born and raised in beautiful Florida, I always had a variety of scenery and inspiration.</p>
		
			<p>My name is Angela Beaulieu and I am 24 years old. I enjoy many activities including cars, fishing, camping and most of all photography. I never leave home without a camera. I am constantly taking pictures everywhere I go...no matter where I go, I always stop dead in my tracks to stare at a potential work of art.</p>
			
			<p>The only way of life for me is creating memories on paper. Pictures so full of life they tell a story, and images so vivid, they take your breath away. This is who I am and this is what I enjoy. I am always willing to photograph anything and anyone, as long as it makes for a wonderful memory captured forever.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy some of my work <span class="pink">:)</span></p>
