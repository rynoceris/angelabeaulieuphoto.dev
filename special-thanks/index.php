			<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
			<p>First of all, I would like to thank my mother and my father. Without them I would not be here today...not only in life, but where I'm at as a photographer. They have always been there for me when times were hard, money was scarce and feelings were hurt. I love you both so very much.</p>

			<p>I also want to thank my wonderful, loving, patient (lol) husband Sean. Any chance he gets, he is there on set to help me with anything I need. He is my own personal critic and he tells me how it is and I appreciate that, it keeps me grounded. Baby I love you!</p>
			
			<p>And last but not least, the most important thank-you goes to all my models, clients, fans, friends and anyone I've taken photos of. Without you guys, Angela Beaulieu Photo would be nothing. Your love and support keep me motivated to create more art and I appreciate everything.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you everyone.</p>
